# React web application based on Marvel API 

Marvel Characters is a React web application for displaying the requested and random Marvel characters as well as information about them.
It is based on Marvel API used via fetch request.
The app constains class and functional, stateless and stateful components, lifecycle methods. I have worked around error and loading time by chaging the relevant component's state.
The styling is done with SCSS.
